<span class="firstline">I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering
at me. </span> Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself -
made me empty out my pockets. I found just what I knew I was going to find. The
American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin, the key ring with the
useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a letter which I
decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two
single shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a
revolver with a single bullet. <span class="firstline"> Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my hand, to give
myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance.
In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name
of the one person capable of passing on the information. He lived in a suburb of
Fenton, less than half an hour away by train. </span> I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky
plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was
terrible. I did not do it for Germany - no! Such a barbarous country is of no
importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy.
Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as
Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he
was Goethe. I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of my race, of
those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me. I wished to prove to him
that a yellow man could save his armies. Besides, I had to escape the Captain. His
hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and beckon at my door.
<span class="firstline"> Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked
a look at the quiet street, and went out. The station was not far from my house, but
I thought it more prudent to take a cab. </span> I told myself that I thus ran less chance of
being recognized. The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and
vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance. I got out
with a painful and deliberate slowness. The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and
vulnerable. <span class="firstline"> I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on. The
train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go
until half past nine. There was almost no one on the platform. </span> I walked through the
carriages. I remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in
Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier. At last the train pulled out. 
A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform. 
It was Captain Richard Madden. Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the
distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the fearful window.

<span class="firstline"> I got up and looked out the window, overhearing a faint sound of traffic nearby, but quickly overheard Madden's voice as if he was down the hallway.</span> Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself -

myself fortitude. Curious, I fired one shot into the sky to feel the rush of adrenaline. It was exciting.
Shortly after, I had built up the arrangement. I searched my house for the phone catalog where I found the name 
of the one individual prepared to do passing on the data. He lived in a suburb of 
Fenton, about an hour away via taxi. </span>

<span class="firstline"> I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but decided to go to the station before for a quick pit stop. I sat on the nearest bench to enjoy a few minutes with my cigarette as the train would leave in a half hour, at eight-fifty.

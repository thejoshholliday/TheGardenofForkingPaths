<span class="firstline"> From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. </span> I told myself that
the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my
adversary in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of
fate. I argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was 
3 not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train schedule, I
would be in prison or dead. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous
happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful
conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never left me.
I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations, that soon only
soldiers and bandits will be left. To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would
undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished,
should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past.
Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the
fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse
coming of night. <span class="firstline"> The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in
the middle of a field. No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some
children on the platform. "Ashgrove," they replied. I got out. A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow.
</span> One of them
asked me: "Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?" Without waiting for my
answer, another said: "The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if
you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad." <span class="firstline"> I threw them a
coin (my last), went down some stone steps and started along a deserted road. At a
slight incline, the road ran downhill. It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the
branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if to keep
me company.</span> For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have divined my
desperate intent. The advice about turning always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for
finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths. I know something about
labyrinths. Not for nothing am I the greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen. He was Governor of
Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than
there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and to create a maze in which all men would lose
themselves. He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before he was
assassinated by a stranger. His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his
labyrinth. Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I
imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I
imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite,
made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers,
provinces and kingdoms . . . I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing
maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the
stars.

Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the
fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse
coming of night. <span class="firstline"> I looked at the right of me and suddenly saw the train parked directly in the middle of the field. As if it appeared out of nowhere. I could hear a faint voice call the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I repeated just to verify. One child closest to the door replies with "Ashgrove." I scurried out. The faintest lamp lit the platform, with a slight glow remaining on the children's faces. </span> One of them
asked me: "Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?" Without waiting for my
answer, another said: "The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if
you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad." <span class="firstline"> I handed them a
dollar, shuffled down old wooden steps and began my route on the cobbled road. At a
slight decline, the road ran uphill. Overhead the branches of trees were isolated from one another, while a crescent moon hung high in the sky between the trees.

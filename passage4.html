<span class="firstline"> But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a
lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by
the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the
moon. A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me.
He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language. </span>
"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude.
No doubt you want to see the garden?"
Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback.
"The garden?"
"The garden of forking paths."
Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance:
"The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."
"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."
<span class="firstline"> The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the house,
we went into a library filled with books from both East and West. I recognized some
large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which was
edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty. </span> They had never been
printed. A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix. I remember also
a rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many centuries, of that blue color which
our potters copied from the Persians . . .
<span class="firstline"> Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I have said,
remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard.</span>
There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor. Later, he 
told me he had been a missionary in Tientsin before he "had aspired to become a
Sinologist." We sat down, I calculated that my pursuer, Richard Madden, could not arrive in
less than an hour. My irrevocable decision could wait.
"A strange destiny," said Stephen Albert, "that of Ts'ui Pen - Governor of his native
province, learned in astronomy, in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the
canonical books, a chess player, a famous poet and a calligrapher. Yet he abandoned
all to make a book and a labyrinth. He gave up all the pleasures of oppression,
justice, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut himself up
in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen years. At his death, his heirs found only
a mess of manuscripts. The family, as you doubtless know, wished to consign them
to the fire, but the executor of the estate - a Taoist or a Buddhist monk - insisted on
their publication."
"Those of the blood of Ts'ui Pen," I replied, "still curse the memory of that monk.
Such a publication was madness. The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory
rough drafts. I examined it once upon a time: the hero dies in the third chapter,
while in the fourth he is alive. As for that other enterprise of Ts'ui Pen . . . his
Labyrinth . . ."
"Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall, laquered writing cabinet.

<span class="firstline"> Between two abandoned houses was a white house, a swinging orange lantern approached; shaped like a full moon with green bead detailing all around the holder. A short man carried it. I could only make out his bushy eyebrows for the light blinded me.
He spoke from behind the gate slowly in my language. </span>

<span class="firstline">The dark path spiraled like those of my childhood. When we reached the atrium,
we turned the corner into a red library filled with books from both East and West. Large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia organized in a pristine order immediately caught my attention. </span> They had never been
printed. A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix. I remember also

There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor. Later, he 
told me he had been a missionary in Tientsin before he "had aspired to become a

large circular clock.

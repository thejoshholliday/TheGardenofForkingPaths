"An ivory labyrinth?" I exclaimed. "A tiny labyrinth indeed . . . !"
"A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me. "An invisible labyrinth of time. I, a
barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery. After
more than a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all
recall, but it isn't hard to image what must have happened. At one time, Ts'ui Pen
must have said; 'I am going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, 'I am
retiring to construct a maze.' <span class="firstline"> Everyone assumed these were separate activities. No
one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same. The Pavilion of
the Limpid Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden. This may have suggested
the idea of a physical maze. </span>
"Ts'ui Pen died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to your family, no one
could find the labyrinth. The novel's confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth.
Two circumstances showed me the direct solution to the problem. First, the curious
legend that Ts'ui Pen had proposed to create an infinite maze, second, a fragment of
a letter which I discovered."
Albert rose. <span class="firstline">For a few moments he turned his back to me. He opened the top
drawer in the high black and gilded writing cabinet. He returned holding in his hand a
piece of paper which had once been crimson but which had faded with the passage
of time: it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular. Ts'ui Pen's calligraphy was justly
famous. </span> Eagerly, but without understanding, I read the words which a man of my
own blood had written with a small brush: "I leave to various future times, but not
to all, my garden of forking paths."
<span class="firstline">I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. </span>Albert went on:
"Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself how a book could be infinite. I
could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular. A volume whose last page
would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely. I
recalled, too, the night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen
Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell
the story of The Thousand and One Nights, with the risk of again arriving at the
night upon which she will relate it, and thus on to infinity. I also imagined a Platonic
hereditary work, passed on from father to son, to which each individual would add a
new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders.

Albert rose.<span class="firstline"> For a few moments he carefully studied my face. He turned around and opened the top

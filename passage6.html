"These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed to have the remotest
application to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen. At this point, I was sent from
Oxford the manuscript you have just seen.
"Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 'I leave to various future times,
but not to all, my garden of forking paths: I had no sooner read this, than I
understood. The Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself. The phrase 'to
various future times, but not to all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in
space. Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory. In all fiction, when a man is
faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others. In the almost
unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - all of them. He thus creates
various futures, various times which start others that will in their turn branch out
and bifurcate in other times. This is the cause of the contradictions in the novel.
"Fang, let us say, has a secret. A stranger knocks at his door. Fang makes up his mind
to kill him. Naturally there are various possible outcomes. Fang can kill the intruder,
the intruder can kill Fang, both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on. In
Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, each one being the point of
departure for other bifurcations. Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth converge.
<span class="firstline">For example, you come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy;
in others my friend.</span>
"If you will put up with my atrocious pronunciation, I would like to read you a few
pages of your ancestor's work."
His countenance, in the bright circle of lamplight, was certainly that of an ancient, but
it shone with something unyielding, even immortal.
With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter. In the first, an
army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass. The bleak and somber
aspect of the rocky landscape made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value,
and so they won the battle easily. In the second, the same army passes through a
palace where a banquet is in progress. The splendor of the feast remained a memory
throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed. <span class="firstline"> With proper veneration I listened to these old tales, although perhaps with less
admiration for them in themselves than for the fact that they had been thought out
by one of my own blood, and that a man of a distant empire had given them back to 
me, in the last stage of a desperate adventure, on a Western island. </span> I remember the
final words, repeated at the end of each version like a secret command: "Thus the
heroes fought, with tranquil heart and bloody sword. They were resigned to killing
and to dying."

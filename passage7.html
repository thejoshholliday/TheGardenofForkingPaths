<span class="firstline">At that moment I felt within me and around me something invisible and intangible
pullulating. It was not the pullulation of two divergent, parallel, and finally converging
armies, but an agitation more inaccessible, more intimate, prefigured by them in
some way.</span> Stephen Albert continued:
"I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations. I do not find
it believable that he would waste thirteen years laboring over a never ending
experiment in rhetoric. In your country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's
period, it was a despised one. Ts'ui Pen was a fine novelist but he was also a man of
letters who, doubtless, considered himself more than a mere novelist. The testimony
of his contemporaries attests to this, and certainly the known facts of his life confirm
his leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical. Philosophical conjectures take
up the greater part of his novel. I know that of all problems, none disquieted him
more, and none concerned him more than the profound one of time. Now then, this
is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden. He does not
even use the word which means time. How can these voluntary omissions be
explained?"
<span class="firstline">I proposed various solutions, all of them inadequate. We discussed them. </span>Finally
Stephen Albert said: "In a guessing game to which the answer is chess, which word is
the only one prohibited?" I thought for a moment and then replied:
"The word is chess."
"Precisely," said Albert. "The Garden of Forking Paths is an enormous guessing game,
or parable, in which the subject is time. The rules of the game forbid the use of the
word itself. To eliminate a word completely, to refer to it by means of inept phrases
and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best way of drawing attention to it. This,
then, is the tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique Ts'ui Pen in every
meandering of his interminable novel. I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I
have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, I have worked out the plan
from this chaos, I have restored, or believe I have restored, the original. <span class="firstline">I have
translated the whole work. I can state categorically that not once has the word time
been used in the whole book.</span> "The explanation is obvious. The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, incomplete
yet not false, of the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be. Differing from
Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and
uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading
network of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time - the strands of
which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the
centuries - embraces every possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some
you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us
exist. In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my gate. In
another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. In yet another, I say these
very same words, but am an error, a phantom."

<span class="firstline">At that point I felt overwhelmed by pullulation of two dissimilar, equal, lastly meeting 
armed forces, that prompted tears to furiously fall down my face, the more difficult it was to stop the more cozy, prefigured by them in 
some way. </span> Stephen Albert continued:

<span class="firstline"> I suggested various scenarios and their scenarios in an attempt to please Albert where he was quickly able to refute each and every single one, to my annoyance.</span> Finally

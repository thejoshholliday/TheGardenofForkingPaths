"In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my voice. "I deeply appreciate and am
grateful to you for the restoration of Ts'ui Pen's garden."
"Not in all," he murmured with a smile. "Time is forever dividing itself toward
innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy."
<span class="firstline">Once again I sensed the pullulation of which I have already spoken. It seemed to me
that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was infinitely saturated with
invisible people. All were Albert and myself, secretive, busy and multiform in other
dimensions of time. I lifted my eyes and the short nightmare disappeared.</span> In the
black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a
statue and this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.
"The future exists now," I replied. "But I am your friend. Can I take another look at
the letter?"
<span class="firstline">Albert rose from his seat. He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high
writing cabinet. For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver
ready. I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once. I swear
that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning.
What remains is unreal and unimportant. Madden broke in and arrested me. I have
been condemned to hang. </span> Abominably, I have yet triumphed! The secret name of the
city to be attacked got through to Berlin. Yesterday it was bombed. I read the news
in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the murder
of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. The Chief,
however, had already solved this mystery. <span class="firstline">He knew that my problem was to shout,
with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, the name of the city called Albert,
and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name.</span> He
does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.

"Not in all," he murmured with a smile. "Time is forever dividing itself toward

<span class="firstline">I look out the windows and make out shadows approaching the house. I rubbed my eyes and could make them out to be
shadow people emerging from the garden, surrounding the house and infinitely multipling with alternate versions of Albert and myself from other linears of time.</span>
From the black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a
statue and this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.
<span class="firstline"> Albert rose again from his seat. He turned to open the top drawer of the high
writing cabinet. With his back facing I looked into my pocket. I had the revolver loaded. With hestiation, I quickly took it out and held it up towards him.
I could hear so many voices in my head. I close my eyes and put the revolver back in my pocket. Albert turned around smiling. I let out a breath of relief and began to walk towards to the kitchen to fix a quick meal before I head out. Madden suddenly came out from the doorway with a grin on his face. He holds a silver plate with a ham sandwich arranged in an artistic manner.</span> Abominably, I have yet triumphed! The secret name of the
city to be attacked got through to Berlin. Yesterday it was bombed. I read the news
in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the murder
of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. The Chief,
however, had already solved this mystery. <span class="firstline">He knew that my problem was to stand out among the rest and step into my mighty voice, screaming the name of the city called Albert, yet I chose the path of peace, rejecting to kill someone of that name.</span>He
does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.
